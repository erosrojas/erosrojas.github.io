    "text": "TLDR: Do not assume anything of your data. Often times you will be wrong.\n  \nBack when I took DSCI-100, I was very new to the data science and statistical modeling world. I was vastly unaware of the absurd number of specialized algorithms created for basically any and all types of problems.\nThis was one of my first full data science reports, and as a result of my previously limited knowledge, there are numerous aspects of the report that are misleading, or flat out misrepresentative of reality. I wish to make this post as a point of progression to see how much I have learned in the past two years, and to be able to recognize what types of mistakes data science beginners generally make. Think of it like a video game ‘remaster’, except the difference being that nobody asked for it.\nBelow you will find my DSCI-100 final report, but with the added bonus of italicized annotations alongside all of the questionable statements and pieces of code that are written."
