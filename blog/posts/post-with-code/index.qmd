## **Breaking down my old DSCI-100 project**
TLDR: Do not assume anything of your data. Often times you will be wrong.

Back when I took DSCI-100, I was very new to the data science and statistical modeling world. I was vastly unaware of the absurd number of specialized algorithms created for basically any and all types of problems. 

This was one of my first full data science reports, and as a result of my previously limited knowledge, there are numerous aspects of the report that are misleading, or flat out misrepresentative of reality. I wish to make this post as a point of progression to see how much I have learned in the past two years, and to be able to recognize what types of mistakes data science beginners generally make. Think of it like a video game 'remaster', except the difference being that nobody asked for it.

Below you will find my DSCI-100 final report, but with the added bonus of italicized annotations alongside all of the questionable statements and pieces of code that are written.
